Designed and developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform specializing in computer games, utilizing PHP and PostgreSQL with phpMyAdmin. The project features user authentication and authorization, distinguishing between three distinct roles: Admin, Moderator, and User. The system enables users to contribute their products to the platform, undergo moderation, and eventually appear on the main page for all visitors. Key functionalities include user-driven game creation, submission for moderation, acceptance or rejection by moderators, and subsequent display on the platform. Users possess the capability to edit or remove their submitted games, while Admins manage user accounts, including the ability to impose bans, and oversee categories with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
